This program's intended function is to take multiple threaded processing in java
and apply it to a real life example of bottling oranges. The goals of this are to
have the threads pass work to each other, and be able to do some basic logic. It
has 4 classes with the main method in the plant file to achieve this task. The 
primary principle is that the worker threads process the oranges within each plant
with the aims to get their work, do their work, and send their work to the next if
necessary.

One thing this lab could have for improvement is a driver class. That is, the main
method would have its own class file and some more passing variables, but then we
see what each class's purpose is individually. Another still would be some of the
statistics seeing fixing and improvement, as most but not all work as intended, and
some are even retooled from the original iterations to ignore some basic problems.
